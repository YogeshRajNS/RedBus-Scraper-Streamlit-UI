# RedBus-Scraper-Streamlit-UI
 Here's a condensed version of the description:  RedBus Web Scraping Project Scrapes bus details from RedBus for 10 states (both government and private). Data includes route name, bus type, timing, rating, price, and availability, stored in MySQL. Streamlit UI offers filtering, displaying average rating and price per route, with booking links.
